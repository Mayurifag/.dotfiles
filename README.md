# Yet another dotfiles repository

## Preparation for MacOS

Update system. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Install zsh with it.

## Installation of this repository

Make sure `zsh` is default shell.

```bash
# ... TODO ...
```

Do not forget:

* Initiate sync on VSCode
* Restore GPG key (TODO: write how to do that from keepassxc)

## Sidenotes for MacOS

* Setup Ilya Birman's layouts, use layout from `macos/` folder (needs guide)
* iCloud â€” delete all the syncs (needs guide)
* Setup iTerm2 like guake <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30850430/iterm2-hide-show-like-guake>
* Sudo with TouchID <https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/quick-tip-enable-touch-id-for-sudo/>
* Setup karabiner (I have config but not sure if something else needed)
* Scroll acceleration mouse fix <https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll>

### Paid macos apps I use

* Bartender

## Sidenotes for Linux

* Setup layouts
  * You need ones with typographic symbols (not sure its easy nowadays, needs guide).
  * Setup CapsLock to change layouts and right Alt as 3rd line modifier.
