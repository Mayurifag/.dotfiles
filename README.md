# Yet another dotfiles repository

## Preparation for MacOS

Update system. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Install zsh with it.

## Installation of environment

Make sure ssh agent is ready to use keepassxc key. 
For that enable sshd service, launch it, check `echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
Final check - entries from `ssh-add -l`.

Also setup gpg key - TODO.
Make sure `zsh` is default shell. (TODO)

Do not forget:

* Initiate sync on VSCode

## Sidenotes for MacOS

* Setup Ilya Birman's layouts, use layout from `macos/` folder (needs guide)
* iCloud â€” delete all the syncs (needs guide)
* Setup iTerm2 like guake <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30850430/iterm2-hide-show-like-guake>
* Sudo with TouchID <https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/quick-tip-enable-touch-id-for-sudo/>
* Setup karabiner (I have config but not sure if something else needed)
* Scroll acceleration mouse fix <https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll>

### Paid macos apps I use (not in Brewfile)

* Bartender
* BetterSnapTool
* GitKraken
* Cleanshot
* ...

## Sidenotes for Linux

* Setup layouts
  * You need ones with typographic symbols (not sure its easy nowadays, needs guide).
  * Setup CapsLock to change layouts and right Alt as 3rd line modifier.
* Setup guake-like terminal and shortcuts

## Roadmap

* Implement a cross-platform package installation script in the Makefile for both Homebrew (macOS) and pacman/yay
* Convert hardcoded paths and OS-specific commands in shell scripts (.zshrc, aliases, etc.) into chezmoi templates to ensure they work on both operating systems.
* Create a linux/settings.sh script to configure system settings using gsettings or dconf, similar to macos/defaults.sh
* Make instructions for installing Golang packages like yawn and lazygit.
* Refactor Zsh configuration files to use a numbered prefix for ordered sourcing (e.g., 10-aliases.zsh).
* Create a guide or script for restoring GPG keys from a backup.
* Identify and list Linux equivalents for the macOS GUI applications currently in the Brewfile.
