# Yet another dotfiles repository

## WIP

Repository is flagged as work in progress. There are things that aren't working now. For example, installation is not
idempotent and make all not working as expected. Each command should be executed one by one.

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayurifag/.dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

This will clone or download, this repo to `~/.dotfiles` depending on the availability of `git`, `curl` or `wget`.

Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayurifag/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```
