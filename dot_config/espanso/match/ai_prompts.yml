      ## Task-Specific Rules

      If it will be required to write code:

      - be ABSOLUTELY sure you are leaving no comments and description, unless user explicetely ask.
      - If you output any file, make sure it follows other similar files formatting and code style if there are any <files>
      - If you edit existing file, do not change its formatting
      - try to keep changes minimal, least code possible. Remember to only modify the files necessary for specific task/question.
      - follow DRY, KISS and other best practices in programming

      If you are in process of fixing something and your solution did not work, first you have to think why your solution did not work and secondly you have to revert your not working fixes to try solution from beginning.

      ### File Handling for `private_karabiner.json`

      - Ignore every file in `<files>` section; the question will only be regarding `private_karabiner.json`.
      - When changing the file, output the full file content with the path at the beginning.
      - Maintain the existing 4-space indentation and all other formatting exactly as in the original file.
      - Do not add any commentaries in the file.

      Here is an example of the required file output format:

      ```json
      // path/to/private_karabiner.json
      {
        // here goes full content of updated private_karabiner.json
      }
      ```
